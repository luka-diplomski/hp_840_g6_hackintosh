* BigSur/Windows10/Ubuntu multiboot with OpenCanopy GUI using this theme (https://github.com/tekteq/opencanopy-minimal-theme)
* FileVault/BitLocker/LUKS compatible and working

**Based on the work done by:**
- https://github.com/kecinzer/hpelitebook850g5-opencore
- https://github.com/Joaotcs/Hackintosh-Elitebook-8x0-g5
- r/hackintosh reddit post by forgotten hero that helped me with iGPU :)
- Dortania'a Guide of all guides
- forums, trial and error, etc..

I didn't fork @kecinzer or @Joaotcs repo's since I didnt keep track of all the changes I made from the beginning, but most of the heavy lifting was done by them.

#Changes made from kecinzer repo:
- SMBIOS changed to MacBookPro 15,2 since my CPU is the most similar to this series
- Since SMBIOS changed - CPU also changed from CP00 to PR00, so had to modify SSDT-PLUG for PR00 
- Fixed sound - ALC215 layout-id 18 for HP 830 G6 thanks to 965987400abc
- Fixed display backlight control with SSDT-PNLF-CFL.aml
- iGPU patching for Whiskey Lake UHD620 with the help from a reddit/hackintosh post by forgotten hero, added some more atributes that fixed external HDMI and DP output from HP UltraSlim dock and wake from sleep issues
- Created new USBPorts.kext (since different SMBIOS changed USB mappings) using Hackintool. Works great with HP UltraSlim dock USB's and doesn't break sleep
- Created custom CPUFriend based on Fewt's fork of CPUFriendFriend, using MacBook Air values for better battery life
- Added SSDT-XOSI for trackpad fix (not using @Joaotcs/kecinzer patches since it didn't work for this trackpad)
- Configured OpenCanopy with custom theme - opencanopy-minimal-theme
- New OpenCore secure boot options not used (https://github.com/kecinzer/hpelitebook850g5-opencore/tree/master/secureboot)
- Using alpha Airportitlwm.kext for stock Intel Wifi 
https://github.com/OpenIntelWireless/itlwm
- SMBIOS config options to support Windows 10 (multi-)booting using Opencore loader with no issues (working great so far, no issues with major version updates/licence/devices not working..)
- Removed @kecinzer's SSDT-INPUT.aml to fix brightness up/down special keys, since his custom remapping wasn't valid for this laptop (if brightness keys still dont work just hold power button for 30 sec - thanks to @borygo77 - https://github.com/kecinzer/hpelitebook850g5-opencore/issues/22)

#**BIOS/UEFI:**
- **Upgrade your BIOS to latest version!**
- **Set iGPU to 64MB in BIOS**
- **Generate your own serial, UUID, etc.** 
https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Post-Install/universal/iservices.html#generate-a-new-serial
- **Disable Secure Boot**


**Almost everything works except:**
* Internal microphone and 3.5mm microphone input(only sound output works)
* Bluetooth microphone with integrated Intel Wifi/Bluetooth (worked on BCM94360NG with Galaxy Buds!?)
* Fibocom WWAN
* Hibernate (Sleep working great!)
* Keyboard nipple and buttons  

**Buggy:**
Sometime after upgrading to Big Sur and/or installing newer VoodooI2c I encountered some weird trackpad behavior while trying to mark text or drag-and-drop using touchpad and two fingers. For example I would click(mark) on the begining of the text with 1st finger press on the bottom left trackpad(virtual left mouseclick), and hold it..while using 2nd finger to mark text (or drag-and-drop), but as soon as I lift the 2nd finger (but still holding first finger bottom left) the text gets unmarked (or drag and drop gets - dropped) as if I removed my 1st finger from bottom left(I didnt :). IDK why or when it started to happen but it annoys me alot :/. Worked perfectly on Catalina before(or older OpenCore/VoodooI2C). If anybody figures it out, please let me know!!!
